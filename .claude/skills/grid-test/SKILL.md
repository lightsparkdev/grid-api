# Grid API Test Suite

End-to-end tests for USDC flows on Solana, Base, and Polygon: deposits, withdrawals, and cross-currency quotes using real testnet (or mainnet) funds.

## Step 1: Parse the User's Prompt

Determine what to run from the user's request:

**Chains** (default: all available — see step 3 for which have keys):
- `solana`, `base`, `polygon`, or `all`
- Multiple chains: "test solana and base", "run base and polygon tests"

**Tests** (default: all):
- By number: "run test 4 on solana"
- By name: "test deposits on base", "test USDC to MXN", "test transfer out"
- By category: "test all quote flows", "test RT funded flows", "test account-funded flows"

**Test name → number mapping:**

| # | Short Name | Keywords |
|---|-----------|----------|
| 1 | account-creation | customer, account, setup |
| 2 | deposit | deposit, fund, send USDC to Grid |
| 3 | transfer-out | withdraw, transfer out, send to wallet |
| 4 | usdc-to-usd-internal-rt | USDC→USD internal, RT funded internal |
| 5 | usdc-to-usd-bank-rt | USDC→USD bank, RT funded ACH, external bank |
| 6 | usdc-to-mxn-rt | USDC→MXN RT, SPEI, CLABE, Mexico RT |
| 7 | usd-to-usdc | USD→USDC, buy USDC, account funded wallet |
| 8 | usdc-to-usd-internal-acct | USDC→USD account funded, convert USDC balance |
| 9 | usdc-to-mxn-acct | USDC→MXN account funded, SPEI account funded |
| 10 | usdc-to-uma-rt | USDC→UMA RT, UMA realtime, send to UMA |
| 11 | usd-to-uma-acct | USD→UMA account funded, UMA payout |

**Category shortcuts:**
- "quote flows" or "quotes" → tests 4-11
- "RT funded" or "realtime" → tests 4-6, 10
- "account funded" → tests 7-9, 11
- "transfers" → tests 2-3
- "UMA" → tests 10-11

## Step 2: Load Credentials

```bash
export GRID_API_TOKEN_ID=$(jq -r .apiTokenId ~/.grid-credentials)
export GRID_API_CLIENT_SECRET=$(jq -r .apiClientSecret ~/.grid-credentials)
export GRID_BASE_URL=$(jq -r '.baseUrl // "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13"' ~/.grid-credentials)
```

## Step 3: Detect Environment

### Sandbox vs non-sandbox

```bash
curl -s -u "$GRID_API_TOKEN_ID:$GRID_API_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 1}' \
  "$GRID_BASE_URL/sandbox/internal-accounts/dummy/fund"
```

- Response contains `"not a sandbox platform"` → `IS_SANDBOX=false`
- Response contains `"not found"` or other non-platform error → `IS_SANDBOX=true`

Use `amount: 1` (not 0) — a zero amount returns a validation error on both sandbox and non-sandbox, masking the real detection.

Report the detected mode to the user.

### Testnet vs mainnet

Check `GRID_BASE_URL` and credential keys to determine network:
- If `IS_SANDBOX=true` or URL contains dev/staging → testnet networks
- If production URL + `IS_SANDBOX=false` → mainnet networks

## Step 4: Set Up Each Selected Chain

For each chain the user wants to test, set the chain-specific variables and verify prerequisites.

### Chain Configuration Lookup

**Testnet (sandbox/dev):**

| Variable | Solana | Base | Polygon |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CRYPTO_NETWORK` | `SOLANA_DEVNET` | `BASE_TESTNET` | `POLYGON_TESTNET` |
| `WALLET_TYPE` | `SOLANA_WALLET` | `BASE_WALLET` | `POLYGON_WALLET` |
| `CRED_KEY` | `solanaDevnetPrivateKey` | `baseTestnetPrivateKey` | `polygonTestnetPrivateKey` |
| `HELPER_SCRIPT` | `scripts/solana_helper.py` | `scripts/base_helper.py` | `scripts/polygon_helper.py` |
| `GAS_CMD` | `sol-balance` | `eth-balance` | `pol-balance` |
| `GAS_TOKEN` | SOL | ETH | POL |
| `GAS_MIN` | 0.1 | 0.001 | 0.1 |
| `TRANSFER_OUT_AMT` | 100000 | 200000 | 200000 |
| `PIP_DEPS` | `solders solana base58` | `web3` | `web3` |

**Mainnet (non-sandbox production):**

| Variable | Solana | Base | Polygon |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CRYPTO_NETWORK` | `SOLANA_MAINNET` | `BASE_MAINNET` | `POLYGON_MAINNET` |
| `WALLET_TYPE` | `SOLANA_WALLET` | `BASE_WALLET` | `POLYGON_WALLET` |
| `CRED_KEY` | `solanaMainnetPrivateKey` | `baseMainnetPrivateKey` | `polygonMainnetPrivateKey` |
| Other vars | Same as testnet | Same as testnet | Same as testnet |

### Per-chain prerequisites

For each selected chain, run these checks. Skip a chain (with a warning) if its private key is missing.

1. **Verify private key exists:**
   ```bash
   jq -r ".$CRED_KEY // empty" ~/.grid-credentials
   ```
   If empty, warn the user and skip this chain.

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip3 install $PIP_DEPS 2>&1 | tail -5
   ```

3. **Define helper function** (pass `--mainnet` if running on mainnet):
   ```bash
   # Testnet:
   chain_helper() { python3 /absolute/path/to/.claude/skills/grid-test/$HELPER_SCRIPT "$@"; }
   # Mainnet:
   chain_helper() { python3 /absolute/path/to/.claude/skills/grid-test/$HELPER_SCRIPT --mainnet "$@"; }
   ```

   Use a shell function (not a variable) so that arguments are word-split correctly. Then call as `chain_helper send-usdc --to ...`. All helper scripts accept `--mainnet` to switch RPC endpoints, chain IDs, USDC contract addresses, and credential keys automatically.

4. **Check gas balance:**
   ```bash
   $CHAIN_HELPER $GAS_CMD
   ```
   If below `GAS_MIN`, warn the user with instructions for obtaining testnet gas:
   - Solana: `$CHAIN_HELPER airdrop-sol --amount 1000000000`
   - Base: https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/base-sepolia
   - Polygon: https://faucet.polygon.technology/

5. **Check USDC balance:**
   ```bash
   $CHAIN_HELPER usdc-balance
   ```
   If `amount` < 1.0 USDC, warn the user. Testnet USDC sources:
   - Solana: Solana devnet USDC faucet
   - Base: https://faucet.circle.com/ (select Base Sepolia)
   - Polygon: https://faucet.circle.com/ (select Polygon Amoy)

6. **Get wallet address:**
   ```bash
   $CHAIN_HELPER wallet-address
   ```
   Save as `WALLET_ADDRESS` for this chain.

## Step 5: Run Tests

Read `references/test-catalog.md` for detailed test steps. Each test is parameterized by chain variables set in Step 4. Run tests sequentially within each chain (later tests depend on state from earlier ones).

**Dependency note:** If the user requests a specific test (e.g., test 4), also run its dependencies:
- Tests 2-11 depend on Test 1 (customer + account creation)
- Tests 3, 8, 9 depend on Test 2 (needs USDC in internal account)
- Tests 7, 11 need USD balance — either sandbox fund endpoint or a prior USDC→USD conversion (Test 4 or 8)
- Tests 10-11 need a valid UMA receiver address (defaults to `$test@sandbox.grid.uma.money`, overridable via `UMA_RECEIVER` env var)

If running a subset, create the customer (Test 1) silently as setup, then run only the requested tests.

**Multi-chain execution:** Run each chain fully before moving to the next. Set `CHAIN_PREFIX` per chain for unique customer IDs:
- Solana: `CHAIN_PREFIX="solana-test"`
- Base: `CHAIN_PREFIX="base-test"`
- Polygon: `CHAIN_PREFIX="polygon-test"`

## Step 6: Results Summary

After all tests complete, print a results table per chain:

```
## Solana Results
| # | Test Case                              | Status | Details |
|---|----------------------------------------|--------|---------|
| 1  | Customer + USDC Account Creation          | PASS   | ...     |
| 2  | Fund Internal Account (deposit)           | PASS   | ...     |
| 3  | Transfer Out (→ wallet)                   | PASS   | ...     |
| 4  | USDC → USD (RT funded → internal)         | PASS   | ...     |
| 5  | USDC → USD (RT funded → external bank)    | PASS   | ...     |
| 6  | USDC → MXN (RT funded → CLABE)            | PASS   | ...     |
| 7  | USD → USDC (Account funded → wallet)      | PASS   | ...     |
| 8  | USDC → USD (Account funded → internal)    | PASS   | ...     |
| 9  | USDC → MXN (Account funded → CLABE)       | PASS   | ...     |
| 10 | USDC → USD (RT funded → UMA)              | PASS   | ...     |
| 11 | USD → USD (Account funded → UMA)          | PASS   | ...     |

## Base Results
...

## Polygon Results
...
```

Include in Details: amounts, transaction IDs, error messages, or timing.

If multiple chains were tested, add an aggregate summary:

```
## Summary
| Chain   | Passed | Failed | Skipped |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| Solana  | 7/7    | 0      | 0       |
| Base    | 6/7    | 1      | 0       |
| Polygon | 0/7    | 0      | 7       |
```

## Error Handling

- If a test fails, record the failure and continue to the next test.
- If a polling loop times out, record FAIL with "timeout after 120s" and the last observed state.
- If `send-usdc` fails, check gas balance (may need airdrop/faucet) and USDC balance.
- If a quote returns an error about `totalSendingAmount` being too small or too large, adjust `lockedCurrencyAmount` and retry once.
- Common API errors:
  - `USER_NOT_FOUND`: sandbox VASP may not have the required user
  - `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`: internal account doesn't have enough funds
  - `QUOTE_EXPIRED`: quote expired before funding — retry with faster execution

## Amounts Reference

All tests use small amounts to conserve testnet funds:

| Test | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 2 (deposit) | 0.50 USDC (500000) | |
| 3 (transfer-out) | Solana: 0.10 USDC (100000), Base/Polygon: 0.20 USDC (200000) | Base/Polygon must exceed ~100100 custody fee |
| 4-5 (USDC→USD RT) | $0.10 locked receiving (10 cents) | |
| 6 (USDC→MXN RT) | 11.00 MXN locked receiving (1100 centavos, ~$0.55) | Some envs enforce 1100 minimum |
| 7 (USD→USDC) | $0.50 sending (50 cents) | Requires sandbox or prior USD balance |
| 8 (USDC→USD acct) | 0.05 USDC sending (50000) | Requires USDC from test 2 |
| 9 (USDC→MXN acct) | 0.05 USDC sending (50000) | Requires USDC from test 2 |
| 10 (USDC→UMA RT) | $0.10 locked receiving (10 cents) | Requires valid UMA receiver |
| 11 (USD→UMA acct) | $0.10 sending (10 cents) | Requires USD balance + valid UMA receiver |

**Total per chain: ~1.3-1.5 USDC + gas fees**

## Credential Schema

`~/.grid-credentials` JSON file:

```json
{
  "apiTokenId": "...",
  "apiClientSecret": "...",
  "baseUrl": "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13",
  "solanaDevnetPrivateKey": "base58-encoded-64-byte-keypair",
  "solanaMainnetPrivateKey": "base58-encoded-64-byte-keypair",
  "baseTestnetPrivateKey": "hex-private-key-with-or-without-0x",
  "baseMainnetPrivateKey": "hex-private-key-with-or-without-0x",
  "polygonTestnetPrivateKey": "hex-private-key-with-or-without-0x",
  "polygonMainnetPrivateKey": "hex-private-key-with-or-without-0x"
}
```

Only the keys for chains you want to test are required. The skill auto-skips chains without keys.
