<Warning>
**Unregulated platforms** require full KYC/KYB verification of customers through hosted flows.
</Warning>

Unregulated platforms must:

- **Hosted KYC Flow**: Use the hosted KYC link for complete identity verification
- **Extended Review**: Customers may require manual review and approval in some cases

### Hosted KYC Link Flow

The hosted KYC flow provides a secure, hosted interface where customers can complete their identity verification and onboarding process.

#### Generate KYC Link


```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/customers/kyc-link?redirectUri=https://yourapp.com/onboarding-complete&platformCustomerId=019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $GRID_CLIENT_ID:$GRID_CLIENT_SECRET"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "kycUrl": "https://kyc.lightspark.com/onboard/abc123def456",
  "platformCustomerId": "019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001"
}
```

#### Complete KYC Process

<Steps>
<Step title="Generate KYC Link">
  Call the `/customers/kyc-link` endpoint with your `redirectUri` parameter to generate a hosted KYC URL for your customer.
  
  <Note>
  The `redirectUri` parameter is embedded in the generated KYC URL and will be used to automatically redirect the customer back to your application after they complete verification.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Redirect Customer">
  Redirect your customer to the returned `kycUrl` where they can complete their identity verification in the hosted interface.
  
  <Warning>
  The KYC link is single-use and expires after a limited time period for security.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Customer Completes Verification">
  The customer completes the identity verification process in the hosted KYC interface, providing required documents and information.
  
  <Info>
  The hosted interface handles document collection, verification checks, and compliance requirements automatically.
  </Info>
  
  <Note>
  After verification processing, you'll receive a KYC status webhook notification indicating the final verification result.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Automatic Redirect">
  Upon successful KYC completion, the customer is automatically redirected to your specified `redirectUri` URL.
  
  <Check>
  The customer account will be automatically created by the system upon successful KYC completion. You can identify the new customer using your `platformCustomerId` or other identifiers.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Handle Completion">
  On your redirect page, handle the completed KYC flow and integrate the new customer into your application.
