**Regulated platforms** have lighter KYC requirements since they handle compliance verification internally.
</Check>

The KYC/KYB flow allows you to onboard customers through direct API calls.

Regulated financial institutions can:

- **Direct API Onboarding**: Create customers directly via API calls with minimal verification
- **Internal KYC/KYB**: Handle identity verification through your own compliance systems
- **Reduced Documentation**: Only provide essential customer information required by your payment counterparty or service provider.
- **Faster Onboarding**: Streamlined process for known, verified customers

#### Creating Customers via Direct API

For regulated platforms, you can create customers directly through the API without requiring external KYC verification:

To register a new customer in the system, use the `POST /customers` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/customers" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $GRID_CLIENT_ID:$GRID_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "platformCustomerId": "customer_12345",
    "customerType": "INDIVIDUAL",
    "fullName": "Jane Doe",
    "birthDate": "1992-03-25",
    "nationality": "US",
    "address": {
      "line1": "123 Pine Street",
      "city": "Seattle",
      "state": "WA",
      "postalCode": "98101",
      "country": "US"
    }
  }'
```

The examples below show a more comprehensive set of data. Not all fields are strictly required by the API for customer creation itself, but become necessary based on currency and UMA provider requirements if using UMA.
