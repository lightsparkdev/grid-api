**Regulated platforms** have lighter KYC requirements since they handle compliance verification internally.
</Check>

The KYC/KYB flow allows you to onboard customers through direct API calls.

Regulated financial institutions can:

- **Direct API Onboarding**: Create customers directly via API calls with minimal verification
- **Internal KYC/KYB**: Handle identity verification through your own compliance systems
- **Reduced Documentation**: Only provide essential customer information required by your payment counterparty or service provider.
- **Faster Onboarding**: Streamlined process for known, verified customers

#### Creating Customers via Direct API

For regulated platforms, you can create customers directly through the API without requiring external KYC verification:

```bash cURL

  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic YOUR_API_CREDENTIALS' \
  -d '{
