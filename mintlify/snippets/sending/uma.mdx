## Sending to a UMA Address 
Send to a UMA address when the receiver is identified by their UMA handle eg $alice@example.com. You'll look up the receiver, create a quote, and then fund.

### Look up the recipient

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/receiver/\$recipient@example.com?platformUserId=9f84e0c2a72c4fa" \
  -u "$GRID_CLIENT_ID:$GRID_CLIENT_SECRET"
```

#### Response
```json Success (200 OK)
{
  "id": "Lookup:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000009",
  "receiver": {
    "handle": "$recipient@example.com",
    "vaspName": "ExampleBank",
    "network": "UMA"
  },
  "supportedCurrencies": [
    { "code": "EUR", "decimals": 2 },
    { "code": "BRL", "decimals": 2 }
  ],
  "requiredPayerFields": [
    "FULL_NAME",
    "BIRTH_DATE"
  ],
  "constraints": {
    "minAmount": { "amount": 100, "currency": { "code": "USD", "decimals": 2 } },
    "maxAmount": { "amount": 10000000, "currency": { "code": "USD", "decimals": 2 } }
  },
  "createdAt": "2025-10-03T15:00:00Z"
}
```
The response includes supported currencies and any required payer information fields.  

If the receiver's VASP requires payer data, include it in `senderUserInfo` (applies to either tab).
### Create a quote

<CodeGroup>
```bash Just-in-time funding
curl -X POST "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/quotes" \
  -u "$GRID_CLIENT_ID:$GRID_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "lookupId": "Lookup:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000009",
    "sendingCurrencyCode": "USD",
    "receivingCurrencyCode": "EUR",
    "lockedCurrencySide": "SENDING",
    "lockedCurrencyAmount": 10000,
    "description": "Invoice #1234 payment",
    "senderUserInfo": { "FULL_NAME": "John Sender", "BIRTH_DATE": "1985-06-15" }
  }'
```

```bash Prefunded (use internal account as source)
curl -X POST "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/quotes" \
  -u "$GRID_CLIENT_ID:$GRID_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "lookupId": "Lookup:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000009",
    "source": { "accountId": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965" },
    "sendingCurrencyCode": "USD",
    "receivingCurrencyCode": "EUR",
    "lockedCurrencySide": "SENDING",
    "lockedCurrencyAmount": 10000,
    "description": "UMA payment from prefunded balance"
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

### Execute payment (just-in-time)

Use the `paymentInstructions` from the quote to instruct your bank to push funds. Include the exact `reference` provided.

### Execute payment (prefunded)

Existing internal account balances will be used to fund the payment. Use the lookup Id above to confirm the payment and execute the quote.

#### Execute the quote

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/quotes/Quote:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000025/execute" \
  -u "$GRID_CLIENT_ID:$GRID_CLIENT_SECRET"
```

Executing the quote creates a transaction that draws from your internal account and delivers to the recipient associated with the UMA address.

#### Track status
Listen for `OUTGOING_PAYMENT` webhooks until the transaction reaches `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`.

You can also query for the transaction with the following snippet:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions/Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000030" \
  -u "$GRID_CLIENT_ID:$GRID_CLIENT_SECRET"
```
