Webhooks enable real-time notifications for transaction status changes, account updates, and customer events. All webhook functionality is shared across Grid use cases.

## Ramps-Specific Webhook Events

When using Grid for Ramps (fiat â†” crypto conversion), you'll primarily work with these webhook types:

- **OUTGOING_PAYMENT**: Notifies you when crypto conversion and delivery completes
- **ACCOUNT_STATUS**: Alerts when external accounts (bank accounts or Spark wallets) are verified
- **KYC_STATUS**: Updates when customer KYC verification completes (for hosted KYC flows)
