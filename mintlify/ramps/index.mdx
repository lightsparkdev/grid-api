### On-Ramp: Fiat to Crypto

Convert fiat currency to cryptocurrency and deliver it to self-custody wallets.

- **Create quotes** to lock exchange rates for fiat-to-crypto conversions
- **Payment instructions** guide users on how to fund their conversion
- **Instant delivery** to Spark wallets or other supported crypto destinations
- **Webhook notifications** confirm successful conversion and delivery

### Off-Ramp: Crypto to Fiat

Convert cryptocurrency to fiat currency and deliver it to bank accounts.

- **Pre-funded accounts** hold crypto balances for conversion
- **Real-time rates** for crypto-to-fiat exchange
- **Bank account delivery** via local payment rails
- **Compliance** handled automatically through Grid's infrastructure

### Funding Options

{rampsProductName} supports multiple funding models for on-ramps and off-ramps:

- **Just-in-time (JIT)**: Create a quote and fund it in real-time using payment instructions (ideal for on-ramps)
- **Pre-funded accounts**: Maintain balances in crypto or fiat and convert from those balances (ideal for off-ramps)

<Tip>
  You can mix funding models based on your use case. On-ramps typically use JIT
  funding, while off-ramps use pre-funded accounts.
</Tip>

### Environments

<Note>
{rampsProductName} supports two environments: **Sandbox** and **Production**.

The Sandbox mirrors production behavior, allowing you to test the full end-to-end flow—from creating quotes and simulating funding to executing conversions and receiving webhooks—without moving real funds.

The Production environment uses live credentials and base URLs for real transactions once you're ready to launch.
