title: "Implementation Overview"
---

This page gives you a 10,000‑ft view of an end‑to‑end Bitcoin rewards implementation. It is intentionally generalized to cover the main building blocks. The detailed guides that follow provide concrete fields, edge cases, and step‑by‑step instructions.

<Info>
This overview highlights the main building blocks: platform setup, funding, customer onboarding, external account creation, and Bitcoin reward distribution.
</Info>

## Platform configuration

Configure your platform once before building user flows.

- Provide webhook endpoints for transaction and account status notifications
- Generate API credentials for Sandbox (and later Production)
- Configure supported currencies (typically a Fiat currency and BTC or stables for rewards)

## Platform account funding

Fund your platform's internal account to enable instant Bitcoin rewards distribution.

- **Platform internal accounts**: Automatically created for each supported currency when your platform is set up
- **Funding options**: ACH transfer, wire transfer, or crypto deposits (BTC, Stablecoins)
- **Balance management**: Monitor balances via API or webhook notifications to ensure sufficient funds for rewards distribution

<Tip>
For Bitcoin rewards, maintaining a prefunded USD balance allows you to instantly purchase and distribute Bitcoin to customers without delays.

## Onboarding customers

For rewards, the only entity who needs to be KYB'd is the entity paying for the reward. This can be you, the platform, or
your business customers that want to pay out rewards to their end users.
All you need in order to pay out a reward is the wallet address.
No need to collect extra personal information or go through the full hosted KYC flow for end users!
To generate a spark wallet, you can use a tool like [Privy](https://privy.io) or the Spark SDK directly.

## External account creation

Register external accounts where customers will receive their Bitcoin rewards.

- **Spark wallets**: Lightning-compatible Spark wallets for instant, low-fee transfers of Bitcoin and Stablecoins
- **Other cryptocurrency wallets**: Support for various Bitcoin destination types
- Capture wallet addresses and validate formats where applicable

<Note>
Spark wallets are recommended for Bitcoin rewards as transfers complete within seconds with minimal fees.
</Note>

## Distributing rewards

Send Bitcoin rewards to customers using a streamlined quote-and-execute flow.

- **Create and execute quote**: Specify source (your platform's USD account), destination (customer's Spark wallet), and amount
- **Currency conversion**: Platform handles USD to BTC conversion at current market rates
- **Immediate execution**: Use `immediatelyExecute: true` for one-step market-order style distribution
- **Monitor status**: Track completion via webhooks or polling

<Tip>
For recurring small-dollar rewards, use `immediatelyExecute: true` to skip the quote confirmation step and send at the current market rate.
</Tip>

## Reconciling transactions

Implement operational processes to keep your ledger in sync.

- Process webhooks idempotently; map statuses (pending, processing, completed, failed)
- Tie transactions back to customers and reward events
- Monitor platform account balances to ensure adequate funding
- Query for transactions by date range or customer as necessary

## Testing in Sandbox

Use Sandbox to build and validate end‑to‑end without moving real funds.

- Simulate account funding using `/sandbox/internal-accounts/{accountId}/fund` endpoint
- Test quote creation, execution, and webhook lifecycles
- Validate customer onboarding flows with test data

## Enabling Production

When you're ready to go live:

- Ensure adequate funding in your production platform account
- Confirm webhook security, monitoring, and alerting are in place
- Review rate limits, error handling, and idempotency
- Run final UAT in Sandbox, then request Production access from our team
