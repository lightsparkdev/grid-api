Webhooks enable real-time notifications for transaction status changes, account updates, and customer events. All webhook functionality is shared across Grid use cases.

## Rewards-Specific Webhook Events

When using Grid for Rewards & Cashback, you'll primarily work with these webhook types:

- **OUTGOING_PAYMENT**: Notifies you when Bitcoin rewards are delivered to customer wallets
- **ACCOUNT_STATUS**: Alerts when customer Spark wallets are verified
- **KYC_STATUS**: Updates when customer KYC verification completes (for hosted KYC flows)
