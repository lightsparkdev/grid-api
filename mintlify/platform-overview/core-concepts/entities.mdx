## Platform Configuration

Your **platform configuration** defines global settings for your Grid integration:

- **Webhook endpoint**: URL where Grid sends event notifications
- **Supported currencies**: Which currencies your platform offers
- **UMA domain** (optional): Your domain for UMA addresses (e.g., `yourplatform.com`)
- **Required counterparty fields** (UMA only): Information required from senders for compliance

Platform configuration is managed via the dashboard or by contacting Lightspark support.

## ID Format

All Grid entities use a consistent ID format:

```
EntityType:UUID
```

Examples:
- `Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001`
- `InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965`
- `Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000030`
- `Quote:a12dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d123`

This format makes IDs self-documenting and easier to debug.

## Platform Customer ID

When creating customers, you can provide your own `platformCustomerId`:

```json
{
  "platformCustomerId": "user_12345_from_my_system",
  "customerType": "INDIVIDUAL",
  "fullName": "Alice Johnson"
}
```

This allows you to:
- Map Grid customers to your internal user IDs
- Query transactions by your own customer identifiers
- Maintain referential integrity between systems

Grid returns both IDs in all customer-related responses:
```json
{
  "id": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
  "platformCustomerId": "user_12345_from_my_system"
}
```

## Amount Representation

All monetary amounts in Grid are represented in the **smallest currency unit**:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Fiat Currencies">
    **Cents, pence, centavos, etc.**

    ```json
    {
      "amount": 50000,
      "currency": {
        "code": "USD",
        "symbol": "$",
        "decimals": 2
      }
    }
    ```

    This represents **$500.00** (50000 cents)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Cryptocurrencies">
    **Satoshis for Bitcoin**

    ```json
    {
      "amount": 10000000,
      "currency": {
        "code": "BTC",
        "symbol": "₿",
        "decimals": 8
      }
    }
    ```

    This represents **0.1 BTC** (10,000,000 satoshis)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The `decimals` field tells you how many decimal places to use when displaying the amount:

```javascript
function formatAmount(amount, currency) {
  const value = amount / Math.pow(10, currency.decimals);
  return `${currency.symbol}${value.toFixed(currency.decimals)}`;
}

// formatAmount(50000, {code: "USD", symbol: "$", decimals: 2}) → "$500.00"
// formatAmount(10000000, {code: "BTC", symbol: "₿", decimals: 8}) → "₿0.10000000"
```

## Timestamps

All timestamps in Grid use **ISO 8601 format with UTC timezone**:

```json
{
  "createdAt": "2025-10-03T15:00:00Z",
  "settledAt": "2025-10-03T15:30:00Z"
}
```

Key timestamp fields:
- **createdAt**: When the entity was created
- **updatedAt**: Last modification time
- **settledAt**: When a transaction completed (transactions only)
- **expiresAt**: When a quote expires (quotes only)
