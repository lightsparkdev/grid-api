Grid supports a wide range of fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, with automatic routing across optimal payment rails based on currency, destination, and speed requirements.

## Supported Currencies

<CountrySupport />

<Note>
Grid automatically selects the optimal rail based on currency, country, and amount. You don't need to specify the rail in your API requests.
</Note>

## Currency Conversion

Grid handles currency conversion automatically through the quote system:

### Exchange Rates

- **Real-time rates**: Grid provides live exchange rates based on market conditions
- **Rate locking**: Quotes lock rates for 1-15 minutes depending on payment type
- **Transparency**: Exact rates and fees shown before execution
- **No hidden fees**: What you see in the quote is what you pay

### Example Conversion Flow

```bash
POST /quotes

{
  "source": {"accountId": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965"},
  "destination": {"accountId": "ExternalAccount:a12dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d123", "currency": "MXN"},
  "lockedCurrencySide": "SENDING",
  "lockedCurrencyAmount": 100000
}
