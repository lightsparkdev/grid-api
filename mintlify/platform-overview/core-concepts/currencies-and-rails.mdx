## Country & Rail Support

<CountrySupport />

<Note>
Grid automatically selects the optimal rail based on currency, country, and amount. You don't need to specify the rail in your API requests.
</Note>

## Currency Conversion

Grid handles currency conversion automatically through the quote system:

### Exchange Rates

- **Real-time rates**: Grid provides live exchange rates based on market conditions
- **Rate locking**: Quotes lock rates for 1-15 minutes depending on payment type
- **Transparency**: Exact rates and fees shown before execution
- **No hidden fees**: What you see in the quote is what you pay

### Example Conversion Flow

```bash
POST /quotes

{
  "source": {"accountId": "InternalAccount:usd-account"},
  "destination": {"accountId": "ExternalAccount:eur-account"},
  "lockedCurrencySide": "SENDING",
  "lockedCurrencyAmount": 100000
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "sendingAmount": {
    "amount": 100000,
    "currency": {"code": "USD", "symbol": "$", "decimals": 2}
  },
  "receivingAmount": {
    "amount": 92000,
    "currency": {"code": "EUR", "symbol": "€", "decimals": 2}
  },
  "exchangeRate": 0.92,
  "fees": {
    "amount": 150,
    "currency": {"code": "USD", "decimals": 2}
  }
}
```

This shows: Send $1,000 → Receive €920 (at rate 0.92), $1.50 fee.

## Multi-Currency Accounts

Customers can hold balances in multiple currencies simultaneously:

```javascript
// Create internal accounts for each currency
const currencies = ['USD', 'EUR', 'GBP', 'BTC'];

for (const currency of currencies) {
  await fetch(`${API_BASE}/customers/internal-accounts`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Basic ${credentials}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      customerId: 'Customer:abc123',
      currency
    })
  });
}
```

Each account:
- Holds balance in one currency
- Has unique funding instructions
- Can send/receive in that currency instantly
- Can convert to other currencies via quotes

## Rail Selection Logic

Grid automatically chooses rails based on:

1. **Currency pair**: USD → EUR routes through FX + SEPA
2. **Destination country**: EUR to Germany uses SEPA Instant
3. **Amount**: Large amounts may use wire instead of ACH
4. **Speed requirements**: Immediate execution prefers instant rails
5. **Cost optimization**: Balances speed vs cost

You don't control rail selection directly—Grid optimizes for you.

## Currency-Specific Considerations

### Fiat Currencies

**US Dollar (USD)**
- Most liquid, widely supported
- Multiple rails available (ACH, RTP, Wire)
- Best for: US domestic, international as base currency

**Euro (EUR)**
- Second most common
- SEPA Instant for fast EU transfers
- Best for: European markets

**Brazilian Real (BRL)**
- PIX enables instant 24/7 transfers
- Popular in Latin America
- Best for: Brazil domestic

**Mexican Peso (MXN)**
- SPEI for real-time transfers
- Growing market
- Best for: Mexico domestic

**British Pound (GBP)**
- Faster Payments for instant transfers
- Best for: UK domestic

**Indian Rupee (INR)**
- UPI for instant low-cost transfers
- Massive market
- Best for: India domestic

### Cryptocurrencies

**Bitcoin (BTC)**
- Lightning Network for instant micro-payments
- Layer 1 for larger, secure transfers
- Volatile pricing—quote locking essential

**Stablecoins (USDC, USDT)**
- Pegged to USD (1:1 target)
- Faster than traditional banking
- Lower volatility than BTC

## Limits & Constraints

### Transaction Limits

| Rail | Minimum | Maximum | Notes |
|------|---------|---------|-------|
| ACH | $0.01 | $1,000,000 | Per transaction |
| RTP | $0.01 | $1,000,000 | Per transaction |

<Note>
Actual limits may vary based on your platform configuration, customer KYC status, and destination requirements. Contact Lightspark for specific limits.
</Note>

### Speed vs Cost Tradeoff

| Rail | Speed | Cost | Best For |
|------|-------|------|----------|
| Lightning | Instant | Very Low | Micro-payments |
| RTP/PIX/UPI | Seconds | Low | Real-time needed |
| SEPA Instant | Minutes | Low | EU instant transfers |
| ACH | 1-2 days | Very Low | Cost optimization |
| Wire | Same day | High | Large, urgent |

## Testing in Sandbox

All currencies and rails work in sandbox with instant settlement simulation:

```bash
# Create sandbox internal account
POST /customers/internal-accounts
{
  "customerId": "Customer:sandbox123",
  "currency": "EUR"
}

# Fund instantly
POST /sandbox/internal-accounts/{accountId}/fund
{
  "amount": 100000
}

# Create EUR → BTC quote
POST /quotes
{
  "source": {"accountId": "InternalAccount:eur-account"},
  "destination": {"accountId": "ExternalAccount:btc-wallet"},
  "lockedCurrencySide": "SENDING",
  "lockedCurrencyAmount": 100000
}
```

Sandbox simulates all rails instantly for rapid testing.
