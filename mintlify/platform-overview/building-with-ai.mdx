Grid's documentation, OpenAPI spec, and CLI are designed to work with AI coding assistants like Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf. Whether you're exploring the API for the first time or building a production integration, AI tools can help you move faster.

## Install the Grid API skill for Claude Code

The Grid API skill gives [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) full access to the Grid API via a built-in CLI. Install it by cloning this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lightsparkdev/grid-api.git
cd grid-api
```

Claude Code automatically detects the skill from the `.claude/skills/` directory. Once inside the repo, you can start asking questions or executing API operations immediately.

### Configure your credentials

```bash
# Build the CLI (first time only)
cd cli && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

# Run interactive setup
node cli/dist/index.js configure
```

This prompts for your API Token ID and Client Secret, validates them, and saves to `~/.grid-credentials`.

## Example prompts

Try these prompts in Claude Code or paste them into your AI assistant of choice:

### Getting started
```
What currencies does Grid support? Show me the coverage by country.
```
```
Walk me through the steps to send a payout from USD to MXN via CLABE.
```

### Payouts
```
Create an external account for a bank in Mexico using CLABE, then create
a quote to send $500 USD and show me the exchange rate before executing.
```
```
Send $100 to $alice@example.com via UMA. Show me the exchange rate first.
```

### On/off-ramps
```
Help me set up a fiat-to-crypto on-ramp. I want to convert USD to BTC
using a Spark wallet.
```
```
I need to off-ramp USDC to a US bank account. Walk me through the full flow.
```

### Account management
```
List all my customers and their KYC status in a table.
```
```
Create a new individual customer and generate a KYC onboarding link.
```

### Debugging
```
I'm getting QUOTE_EXPIRED errors. What's happening and how do I fix it?
```
```
My external account creation is failing for a Nigerian bank account.
What fields am I missing?
```

## Using the Grid CLI

The Grid API skill uses a CLI tool that can execute real API operations. Here are the key commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `customers list` | List all customers |
| `customers create` | Create a new customer |
| `accounts internal list` | List internal accounts |
| `accounts external create` | Create a bank account or wallet |
| `quotes create` | Get an exchange rate quote |
| `quotes execute` | Execute a locked quote |
| `transactions list` | List transactions |
| `sandbox fund` | Fund a sandbox account for testing |

All commands support `--format table` for human-readable output. Use aliases for speed: `cust`, `tx`, `acct`.

<Tip>
Start in the sandbox environment to experiment safely. Use `sandbox fund` to add test funds to any internal account.
</Tip>

## AI-accessible documentation

Grid docs are automatically available to LLMs and AI tools in machine-readable formats — no configuration needed.

### llms.txt

Grid docs generate [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) files that give AI tools a structured index of all documentation:

- [`/llms.txt`](/llms.txt) — Concise index of all pages with titles and descriptions
- [`/llms-full.txt`](/llms-full.txt) — Complete documentation content in a single file

These are generated automatically and always up to date. Use `llms-full.txt` when you want to give an AI assistant full context about the Grid API in one shot.

### Paste a docs page into any AI chat

You can copy any page's content and paste it directly into ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI assistant for context-aware help with your specific question.

## Tips for best results

1. **Be specific about your use case** — "Send a payout to Brazil via PIX" gets better results than "help me send money"
2. **Start with the sandbox** — Ask the AI to use sandbox mode so you can experiment without real funds
3. **Give context** — Paste the relevant docs page or point the AI to `/llms-full.txt` for full API context
4. **Iterate on errors** — If an API call fails, paste the error and ask the AI to diagnose it
5. **Use table format** — Ask for `--format table` output when exploring data
