Grid's documentation, OpenAPI spec, and CLI are designed to work with AI coding assistants like Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex. Whether you're exploring the API for the first time or building a production integration, AI tools can help you move faster.

## AI-accessible documentation

These Grid docs are automatically available to LLMs and AI tools in machine-readable formats — no configuration needed.

### llms.txt

Grid docs generate [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) files that give AI tools a structured index of all documentation:

- [`/llms.txt`](/llms.txt) — Concise index of all pages with titles and descriptions
- [`/llms-full.txt`](/llms-full.txt) — Complete documentation content in a single file

These are generated automatically and always up to date. Use `llms-full.txt` when you want to give an AI assistant full context about the Grid API in one shot.

### Markdown export

Each page in the Grid docs is automatically available as a Markdown file simply by adding `.md` to the end of the URL.

For example, the [Building with AI](/platform-overview/building-with-ai) page is available as [`/platform-overview/building-with-ai.md`](/platform-overview/building-with-ai.md).

<Tip>
You can also copy any page's content as Markdown with the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> on Windows) and paste it directly into ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI assistant for context-aware help with your specific question.
</Tip>

## Install the Grid API agent skill

The Grid API skill gives [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) or another Skill-compatible agent full access to the Grid API via a built-in CLI. Install it with:

```bash
npx skills add lightsparkdev/grid-api
```

Make sure to install it for whichever agent you're using. For example, if you're using Claude Code,
you'll need to explicitly select Claude Code in the agent installation selection screen.

Once installed, you can start asking questions immediately. To execute API operations, you'll need to
configure your credentials.

### Configure your credentials

```bash
# Build the CLI (first time only)
cd cli && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

# Run interactive setup
node cli/dist/index.js configure
```

This prompts for your API Token ID and Client Secret, validates them, and saves to `~/.grid-credentials`.

<Tip>
Start in the sandbox environment to experiment safely. The Skill is great at generating fake account data to help you test different flows.
</Tip>

## Example prompts

Try these prompts in Claude Code or paste them into your AI assistant of choice:

### Getting started
```
What currencies does Grid support? Show me the coverage by country.
```
```
Walk me through the steps to send a payout from USD to MXN via CLABE.
```

### Payouts
```
Create an external account for a bank in Mexico using CLABE, then create
a quote to send $500 USD and show me the exchange rate before executing.
```
```
Send $100 to $alice@example.com via UMA. Show me the exchange rate first.
```

### On/off-ramps
```
Help me set up a fiat-to-crypto on-ramp. I want to convert USD to BTC
using a Spark wallet.
```
```
I need to off-ramp USDC to a US bank account. Walk me through the full flow.
```

### Account management
```
List all my customers and their KYC status in a table.
```
```
Create a new individual customer and generate a KYC onboarding link.
```

### Debugging
```
I'm getting QUOTE_EXPIRED errors. What's happening and how do I fix it?
```
```
My external account creation is failing for a Nigerian bank account.
What fields am I missing?
```

## Using the Grid CLI

The Grid API skill uses a CLI tool that can execute real API operations. You can also access the CLI directly by running `node cli/dist/index.js <command>`. Here are the key commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `customers list` | List all customers |
| `customers create` | Create a new customer |
| `accounts internal list` | List internal accounts |
| `accounts external create` | Create a bank account or wallet |
| `quotes create` | Get an exchange rate quote |
| `quotes execute` | Execute a locked quote |
| `transactions list` | List transactions |
| `sandbox fund` | Fund a sandbox account for testing |

All commands support `--format table` for human-readable output. Use aliases for speed: `cust`, `tx`, `acct`.

## Tips for best results

1. **Be specific about your use case** — "Send a payout to Brazil via PIX" gets better results than "help me send money"
2. **Start with the sandbox** — Ask the AI to use sandbox mode so you can experiment without real funds
3. **Give context** — Paste the relevant docs page or point the AI to `/llms-full.txt` for full API context
4. **Iterate on errors** — If an API call fails, paste the error and ask the AI to diagnose it
5. **Use table format** — Ask for `--format table` output when exploring data
