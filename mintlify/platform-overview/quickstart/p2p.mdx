## Overview

Grid's Global P2P API enables payments via Universal Money Addresses (UMA). In this quickstart, you'll:

1. Set up your platform
2. Resolve an UMA address
3. Send a payment

## Prerequisites

- A Grid API key ([request sandbox access](https://lightspark.com/grid#signup))
- Basic understanding of REST APIs and UMA

## What is UMA?

Universal Money Address (UMA) is an open standard that enables payments using human-readable addresses like `$alice@example.com`.

## Step 1: Platform Configuration

Configure your platform for Global P2P payments.

## Step 2: Resolve UMA Address

Look up the recipient's UMA address to get payment details.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/receiver/uma/\$alice@example.com" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Step 3: Send Payment

Execute a payment to the resolved UMA address.

```bash
# Get a quote
curl -X POST https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/quotes \
  -H "Authorization: Basic YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "receiver_uma": "$alice@example.com",
    "sending_currency": "USD",
    "amount": "50.00"
  }'

# Execute the payment
curl -X POST https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Basic YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "quote_id": "QUOTE_ID"
  }'
```
