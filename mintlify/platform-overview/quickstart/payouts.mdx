## Step 2: Create a Customer

Create a customer entity to represent the recipient of your payout.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/customers \
  -H "Authorization: Basic YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  }'
```

## Step 3: Configure Accounts

## Step 4: Send a Payment

  -H "Authorization: Basic YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source_currency": "USD",
    "destination_currency": "MXN",
    "amount": "100.00"
  }'

# Execute the payment
curl -X POST https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions \
  -H "Authorization: Basic YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
