Grid is a low-level payment infrastructure API that enables modern financial institutions, businesses, or any developer to send, receive, and settle value globally across fiat currencies, stablecoins, and Bitcoin. With a single, simple API, you can build applications that move money instantly across borders without the complexity of orchestrating multiple payment rails or currencies.

## What to build

Grid's APIs are intentionally low-level, giving developers, institutions, and businesses full control to build any payment flow. Fiat, crypto, or both.

Whether you're receiving Bitcoin or sending dollars as pesos to a bank account, the APIs stay completely unopinionated; you decide the flow. Each path has its own nuances, and our team can help you design the best one for your use case.
