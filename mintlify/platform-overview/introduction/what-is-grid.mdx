title: "What is Grid?"
---

Grid is a low-level payment infrastructure API that enables modern financial institutions, businesses, or any developer to send, receive, and settle value globally across fiat currencies, stablecoins, and Bitcoin. With a single, simple API, you can build applications that move money instantly across borders without the complexity of orchestrating multiple payment rails or currencies.

## What to build

Grid's APIs are intentionally low-level, giving developers, institutions, and businesses full control to build any payment flow. Fiat, crypto, or both.

Whether you're receiving Bitcoin or sending dollars as pesos to a bank account, the APIs stay completely unopinionated, you decide the flow. Each path has its own nuances, and our team can help you design the best one for your use case.
