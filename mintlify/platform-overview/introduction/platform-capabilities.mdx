## UMA-Based Payments

Grid fully implements the UMA protocol for human-readable payment addresses and cross-platform interoperability.

### Sending UMA Payments

Look up recipient UMA addresses and send payments across different platforms:

1. **Receiver lookup**: Resolve `$alice@otherplatform.com` to get payment details
2. **Required fields**: Grid returns what information is required (name, address, etc.)
3. **Compliance exchange**: Send sender information for recipient platform screening
4. **Quote & execute**: Get locked rate and execute payment

### Receiving UMA Payments

Expose your customers' UMA addresses to receive payments from any UMA-compatible platform:

1. **Webhook notification**: Receive `INCOMING_PAYMENT` webhook with sender info
2. **Compliance review**: Review counterparty information automatically or manually
3. **Approve/reject**: Respond with approval or rejection within 5 seconds
4. **Automatic settlement**: Funds delivered to customer account in their preferred currency

### Invitation System

Acquire new customers through pay-by-link invitations:

- Create invitation links with pre-filled payment amounts
- Share via email, SMS, or social media
- Customers sign up and receive payment instantly
- Track invitation claims via webhooks

## Reconciliation & Reporting

### Webhook-Based Reconciliation

Receive real-time notifications for all payment state changes:

- **Transaction status updates**: PENDING → COMPLETED or FAILED
- **Internal account funding**: ACH deposits, wire receipts, crypto deposits
- **External account status**: Account verification, screening results
- **KYC status changes**: Customer approval/rejection

### Query-Based Reconciliation

Poll for transaction status when needed:

- List transactions with filters (customer, date range, status)
- Get detailed transaction information
- Query internal account balances
- Review external account states

### Idempotency

All critical operations support idempotency keys for safe retries:

- Create customers, quotes, and transactions with unique IDs
- Safely retry failed requests without duplicates
- Reconcile by checking idempotency key matches

## Testing & Development

### Sandbox Environment

Full-featured sandbox environment for development:

- All API endpoints work identically to production
- Instant settlement simulation
- Test scenarios via special account patterns
- Webhook testing and debugging
- No real money movement

### Special Test Patterns

Control sandbox behavior with magic account numbers:

- Account ending in `002`: Insufficient funds
- Account ending in `003`: Account closed/invalid
- Account ending in `004`: Transfer rejected
- Account ending in `005`: Timeout (pending → failed after 30s)

### Developer Tools

- **Postman collection**: Pre-built API requests
- **UMA test wallet**: Test UMA payment flows
- **Dashboard logs**: Detailed request/response inspection
- **Webhook replay**: Retry webhook delivery for testing
