Webhooks enable real-time notifications for transaction status changes, account updates, and customer events. All webhook functionality is shared across Grid use cases.

For complete webhook documentation, see the Platform Overview section:

## Global P2P-Specific Webhook Events

When using Grid for Global P2P, you'll work with these webhook types:

- **INCOMING_PAYMENT**: Notifies you of incoming payments that require approval (must respond within 5 seconds with approval/rejection)
- **OUTGOING_PAYMENT**: Notifies you when sent payments complete or fail
- **INVITATION_CLAIMED**: Alerts when pay-by-link invitations are claimed
- **ACCOUNT_STATUS**: Updates when external accounts are verified
- **KYC_STATUS**: Updates when customer KYC verification completes

<Warning>
**INCOMING_PAYMENT** webhooks with status `PENDING` require a response within 5 seconds to approve or reject the payment. See the full webhooks guide for implementation details.
