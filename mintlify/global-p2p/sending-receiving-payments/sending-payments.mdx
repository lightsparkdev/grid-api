title: "Sending Payments"
---
This guide covers three methods to send payments:

1. Same-currency transfer to an external account
2. Cross-currency transfer with a quote
3. Sending to a UMA address

## Choosing the right method

- **Same-currency**: Best for domestic payouts when sender and recipient use the same currency. Uses local payment rails (e.g., RTP, SEPA Instant, PIX, FPS) for low cost and fast settlement.
- **Cross-currency**: Use when conversion is required or when paying globally across borders. Also supports sending to a crypto wallet address when configured.
- **UMA**: Send using a Universal Money Address. Ideal for global counterparties on networks.
