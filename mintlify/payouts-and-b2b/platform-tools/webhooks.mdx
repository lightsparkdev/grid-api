Webhooks enable real-time notifications for transaction status changes, account updates, and customer events. All webhook functionality is shared across Grid use cases.

For complete webhook documentation, see the Platform Overview section:

## Payouts-Specific Webhook Events

When using Grid for Payouts & B2B, you'll primarily work with these webhook types:

- **OUTGOING_PAYMENT**: Notifies you when payout status changes (`PENDING` → `PROCESSING` → `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`)
- **ACCOUNT_STATUS**: Alerts when external bank accounts are verified or rejected
- **KYC_STATUS**: Updates when customer KYC verification completes (for hosted KYC flows)
