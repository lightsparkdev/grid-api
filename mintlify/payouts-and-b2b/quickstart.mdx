This quickstart covers an example of sending a prefunded cross-border payout for a business customer on an unregulated platform.

## Understanding Entity Mapping for B2B Payouts

In this guide, the entities map as follows:

| Entity Type | Who They Are | In This Example |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Platform** | Your payouts platform | Your company providing AP automation |
| **Customer** | Business sending payments | Your client company (e.g., Acme Corp) |
| **External Account** | Vendors receiving payments | Maria Garcia (freelance contractor in Mexico) |

**Flow**: Your customer (a business) funds their internal account → uses your platform to send payments → to their vendors' external bank accounts.

## Get API credentials
  Create Sandbox API credentials in the dashboard, then set environment variables for local use.

  ```bash
  export GRID_BASE_URL="https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13"
  export GRID_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_SANDBOX_CLIENT_ID"
  export GRID_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_SANDBOX_CLIENT_SECRET"
  ```

  <Tip>
  Use Basic Auth in cURL with `-u "$GRID_CLIENT_ID:$GRID_API_SECRET"`.
  </Tip>

## Onboard a Customer
Onboard a customer using the hosted KYC/KYB link flow.
### Generate KYC Link
  Call the `/customers/kyc-link` endpoint with your `redirectUri` parameter to generate a hosted KYC URL for your customer.
  
  <Note>
  The `redirectUri` parameter is embedded in the generated KYC URL and will be used to automatically redirect the customer back to your application after they complete verification.
  </Note>
  ```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/customers/kyc-link?redirectUri=https://yourapp.com/onboarding-complete&platformCustomerId=019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $GRID_CLIENT_ID:$GRID_CLIENT_SECRET"
```
**Response:**

```json
{
  "kycUrl": "https://kyc.lightspark.com/onboard/abc123def456",
  "platformCustomerId": "019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001"
}
```
### Redirect Customer
  Redirect your customer to the returned `kycUrl` where they can complete their identity verification in the hosted interface.
  
  <Warning>
  The KYC link is single-use and expires after a limited time period for security.
  </Warning>

### Customer Completes Verification
  The customer completes the identity verification process in the hosted KYC interface, providing required documents and information.
  
  <Info>
  The hosted interface handles document collection, verification checks, and compliance requirements automatically.
  </Info>
  
  <Note>
  After verification processing, you'll receive a KYC status webhook notification indicating the final verification result.
  </Note>

### Redirect back to your app
  Upon successful KYC completion, the customer is automatically redirected to your specified `redirectUri` URL.
  
  On your redirect page, handle the completed KYC flow and integrate the new customer into your application.

  <Check>
  The customer account will be automatically created by the system upon successful KYC completion. You can identify the new customer using your `platformCustomerId` or other identifiers.
  </Check>

## Get the Customer's Internal Account

Once the customer is created, internal accounts will automatically be created on their behalf. Get their internal account in the desired currency for funding instructions.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/internal-account?customerId=Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001&currency=USD" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $GRID_CLIENT_ID:$GRID_CLIENT_SECRET"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965",
      "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
      "balance": {
        "amount": 0, // USD balance in cents
        "currency": {
          "code": "USD",
          "name": "United States Dollar",
          "symbol": "$",
          "decimals": 2
        }
      },
      "fundingPaymentInstructions": [
        {
          "instructionsNotes": "Include the reference code in your ACH transfer memo",
          "accountOrWalletInfo": {
            "reference": "FUND-ABC123",
            "accountType": "US_ACCOUNT",
            "accountNumber": "9876543210",
            "routingNumber": "021000021",
            "accountHolderName": "Lightspark Payments FBO John Doe",
            "bankName": "JP Morgan Chase"
          }
        },
        {
          "accountOrWalletInfo": {
            "accountType": "SOLANA_WALLET",
            "assetType": "USDC",
            "address": "4Nd1m6Qkq7RfKuE5vQ9qP9Tn6H94Ueqb4xXHzsAbd8Wg"
          }
        }
      ],
      "createdAt": "2025-10-03T12:00:00Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-10-03T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "hasMore": false,
  "totalCount": 1
}
```

The `fundingPaymentInstructions` provide the bank account details and reference code needed to fund
this internal account via ACH or wire transfer from the customer's bank. It might also include stablecoin
funding details for instant funding of the internal account.

## Fund the Internal Account

For this quickstart, we'll fund the account using the `/sandbox/internal-accounts/{accountId}/fund` endpoint to simulate receiving funds.

In production, your customer would initiate a transfer from their bank or wallet to the account details provided in the funding instructions,
making sure to include the reference code `FUND-ABC123` in the transfer memo if applicable.

```bash
# Sandbox: fund internal account directly
curl -X POST "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/sandbox/internal-accounts/InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965/fund" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $GRID_CLIENT_ID:$GRID_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "currencyCode": "USD",
    "currencyAmount": 100000,
    "reference": "FUND-ABC123"
  }'
```

During the funding process, you'll receive transaction status update webhooks.

**Webhook Notification:**
```json
{
  "transaction": {
    "id": "Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000010",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "type": "INCOMING",
    "receivedAmount": {
      "amount": 100000,
      "currency": {
        "code": "USD",
        "name": "United States Dollar",
        "symbol": "$",
        "decimals": 2
      }
    },
    "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
    "settledAt": "2025-10-03T14:30:00Z",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-03T14:25:00Z",
    "description": "Internal account funding"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-03T14:32:00Z",
  "webhookId": "Webhook:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000020",
  "type": "INCOMING_PAYMENT"
}
```

The internal account now has a balance of $1,000.00 (100000 cents).
## Add the beneficiary as an External Account

Now add the beneficiary bank account where you want to send the funds. In this example, we'll add a
Mexican CLABE account as the external account.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/customers/external-accounts" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $GRID_CLIENT_ID:$GRID_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

    "currency": "MXN",
    "platformAccountId": "maria_garcia_account",
    "accountInfo": {
      "accountType": "CLABE",
      "clabeNumber": "123456789012345678",
      "bankName": "BBVA Mexico",
      "beneficiary": {
        "beneficiaryType": "INDIVIDUAL",

          "country": "MX"
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

        "country": "MX"
      }
    }

## Create a quote
Create a quote to lock in the exchange rate, fees, and get the  transfer details.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/quotes" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $GRID_CLIENT_ID:$GRID_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "lookupId": "LookupRequest:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000009", # ID from the lookup step
    "source": {
      "accountId": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965" # USD internal account
    },
    "destination": {
      "accountId": "ExternalAccount:a12dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d123",
      "currency": "MXN"
    },
    "lockedCurrencySide": "SENDING",
    "lockedCurrencyAmount": 50000,
    "description": "Payment to Maria Garcia for services"
  }'
```

<Note>
  **Amount Locking**: You can lock either the sending amount (`SENDING`) or receiving amount (`RECEIVING`).
  In this example, we're locking the sending amount to exactly $500.00 USD (50000 cents). Alternatively,
  you can lock the receiving amount to ensure that the receiver receives exactly some amount of the
  destination currency.
</Note>
