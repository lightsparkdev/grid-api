Implementing cross-border payments with {payToBankProductName} is simple. Here's a quick overview of the main steps.

### Onboarding customers

<Info>
{payToBankProductName} has two customer onboarding options - one for non regulated entities where {payToBankProductName} handles the KYC/KYB process and one for regulated entities where you handle the KYC/KYB process.

When creating customers, you'll be able to also connect external accounts or internal accounts to a specific customer and also add accounts for counterparties on the receiving end. 
To learn more about accounts read our [internal accounts guide](/payouts-and-b2b/depositing-funds/internal-accounts) or setting up [external accounts guide](/payouts-and-b2b/depositing-funds/external-accounts)
</Info>

### Funding Payments
{payToBankProductName} supports multiple transaction funding options including prefunded accounts and real-time funding. You can prefund an account using several payment rails such as ACH, SEPA Instant, wire transfers, Lightning, and more.  

With real-time funding, you'll receive payment instructions as part of the quote. Once payment is received by our services, we'll initiate the payment to the receiver. 

### Sending Payments
To send with {payToBankProductName}, onboard an account for a customer and the counter party, then execute and fund a quote. {payToBankProductName} resolves the receiver by external bank details, returns min/max and an exchange rate, and provides funding instructions. Once funded, {payToBankProductName} handles FX and delivery to the receiving account.

### Environments

<Note>
{payToBankProductName} supports two environments: Sandbox and Production. Sandbox mirrors production behavior and webhooks so you can test receiver resolution, quotes and funding instructions, settlement status changes, and full end‑to‑end flows without moving real funds. Production uses live credentials and base URLs for real payments once you’re ready to launch.
