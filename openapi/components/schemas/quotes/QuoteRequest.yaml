  immediatelyExecute:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      Whether to immediately execute the quote after creation. If true,
      the quote will be executed and the transaction will be created at
      the current exchange rate. It should only be used if you don't want
      to lock and view rate details before executing the quote. If you are
      executing a pre-existing quote, use the `/quotes/{quoteId}/execute`
      endpoint instead. This is false by default.
    example: false
