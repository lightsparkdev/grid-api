          If customerId is not provided, the quote will be created on behalf of the platform itself.

      Fund the quote using a real-time funding source (RTP, SEPA Instant, Spark, Stables, etc.).
      This will require manual just-in-time funding using `paymentInstructions` in the response.
      Because quotes expire quickly, this option is only valid for instant payment methods. Do not try
      to fund a quote with a non-instant payment method (ACH, etc.).
