      This is optional and if not provided, the invitee will not
      receive any amount. Note that the actual sending of

      the amount must be done by the inviter platform once the
      INVITATION_CLAIMED webhook is received. If the inviter

      platform either does not send the payment or the payment fails,
      the invitee will not receive this amount. This

      field is primarily used for display purposes on the claiming
      side of the invitation.
