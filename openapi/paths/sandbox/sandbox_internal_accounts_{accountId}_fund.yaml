  summary: Simulate funding an internal account
  description: >
    Simulate receiving funds into an internal account in the sandbox environment.
    This is useful for testing scenarios where you need to add funds to a customer's
    or platform's internal account without going through a real bank transfer or
    following payment instructions.

    This endpoint is only for the sandbox environment and will fail for
    production platforms/keys.
